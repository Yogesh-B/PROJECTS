111
Write a program to demonstrate indexers. 
Detail: Create a class to process results (CPI Range 0.0 to 10.0) of n students. 
The purpose is to count number of students per range.
 Range 1 is 0.0 to 0.99, Range 2 is 1.0 to 1.99 and so on. 
So total 11 counts are possible. Use indexer to accept a double number (CPI value) and
update respective counter. Implement a method to display range counts too.

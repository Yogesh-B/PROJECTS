Write a program to demonstrate delegates.

Detail: Create a class to implement string manipulation methods (uppercase, lowercase and
reverse). Create a class to use these methods with the use of multicast delegates. Use a menu
driven user input for the selection of string manipulation operations.
For example, User needs to enter 1 for uppercase conversion, 2 for lowercase conversion, 3
for reverse, 4 for uppercase and lowercase, 5 for uppercase and reverse, 6 for lowercase and 
reverse and 7 for all operations.
